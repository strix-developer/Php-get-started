            <h1>Toxic</h1>
            <p>Heavy metal toxicity has proven to be a major threat and there are several health risks associated with
                it. The toxic effects of these metals, even though they do not have any biological role, remain present
                in some or the other form harmful for the human body and its proper functioning. They sometimes act as a
                pseudo element of the body while at certain times they may even interfere with metabolic processes. Few
                metals, such as aluminium, can be removed through elimination activities, while some metals get
                accumulated in the body and food chain, exhibiting a chronic nature. Various public health measures have
                been undertaken to control, prevent and treat metal toxicity occurring at various levels, such as
                occupational exposure, accidents and environmental factors. Metal toxicity depends upon the absorbed
                dose, the route of exposure and duration of exposure, i.e. acute or chronic. This can lead to various
                disorders and can also result in excessive damage due to oxidative stress induced by free radical
                formation. This review gives details about some heavy metals and their toxicity mechanisms, along with
                their health effects.</p>
            <h1>Jinx</h1>
            <p>Mr. Durst has been in jail since 2015, when he was arrested in New Orleans and charged with Ms. Berman’s
                murder just hours before the final episode of “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst” aired on
                HBO. The authorities said they suspected that he was about to flee the country.

                The upcoming trial, which could last as long as five months, is expected to refocus the media spotlight
                on the long, complicated story of Mr. Durst, once considered the heir apparent to a vast New York real
                estate empire. Already, NBC’s Dateline, ABC’s 20/20 and CNN Headline News are planning episodes.

                The police in Los Angeles found Ms. Berman’s body in 2000 after neighbors notified them that her back
                door was ajar and her terriers were running free. There was no sign of forced entry. Nothing had been
                taken, and no fingerprints or DNA were found from the killer.

                Prosecutors contend that Mr. Durst killed Ms. Berman because he feared that she was about to tell the
                authorities what she knew about the 1982 disappearance and murder of Mr. Durst’s first wife, Kathie
                McCormack Durst, in New York, five months before she would have graduated from medical school.

                Ms. Berman, who friends say was fiercely loyal to Mr. Durst, was his spokeswoman and media adviser at
                the time. Prosecutors and witnesses say she also made a critical call while posing as Kathie Durst that
                redirected New York police detectives away from the actual crime scene and hobbled the investigation.

                The “cadaver note” that arrived at the Beverly Hills police department became a key piece of evidence in
                Ms. Berman’s death. After clearing various suspects, the Los Angeles police got a court order in 2002
                for handwriting samples from Mr. Durst to compare with the block lettering on the note.

                By then, Mr. Durst was in jail in Galveston, Texas, charged with the killing and dismembering of Morris
                Black, a man who had lived across the hall from him. The two men became friendly after Mr. Durst left
                New York in 2000, when the authorities reopened the investigation into his wife’s disappearance.</p>
            <h1>Jerry</h1>
            <p>Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by
                William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,
                the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named
                Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.

                In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958.[1]
                During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, tying for first place with
                Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed
                in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry shorts for
                Rembrandt Films from 1961 to 1962. Tom and Jerry then became the highest-grossing animated short film
                series of that time, overtaking Looney Tunes. Chuck Jones then produced another 34 shorts with Sib Tower
                12 Productions between 1963 and 1967. Three more shorts were produced, The Mansion Cat in 2001, The
                Karate Guard in 2005, and A Fundraising Adventure in 2014, making a total of 164 shorts.

                A number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series The Tom and Jerry Show (1975), The
                Tom and Jerry Comedy Show (1980–1982), Tom & Jerry Kids (1990–1993), Tom and Jerry Tales (2006–2008),
                and The Tom and Jerry Show (2014–2021). The first feature-length film based on the series, Tom and
                Jerry: The Movie, was released in 1992, and 13 direct-to-video films have been produced since 2002, with
                a live-action/animated hybrid film released in 2021. A musical adaptation of the series, titled Tom and
                Jerry: Purr-Chance to Dream, debuted in Japan in 2019 in advance of Tom and Jerry's 80th anniversary.

            <h1>Zester</h1>
            <p>Dominance is a key theme in StarCraft II’s 2018. WCS and GSL alike were swept by a single competitor
                each—Serral and Maru. They each faced different opponents in every grand final, but always came out
                victorious. That is unusual. So unusual, in fact, that many interesting story-lines flew largely under
                the radar. Zest’s is one of them.

                There is mystery surrounding what, judging purely by results, was not a bad year for Zest, especially
                compared to the atrocity that was 2017. On paper, the narrative is simple and not at all uncommon; a
                championship player falls off after reaching his peak, but, through a combination of talent, hard work,
                experience, and motivation, overcomes the slump to become a tournament challenger again. In fact, we’ve
                written this very story about Zest before, when he returned to peak form in 2016 after experiencing a
                disappointing year in 2015—by his pre-set standards, that is. What’s so special about Zest repeating the
                feat and reaching another GSL final?

                There is a perplexing contrast of results and gameplay. Zest’s success, whether it came in 2014 or 2016,
                was always based on the same foundations—rock solid decision-making, clean and intelligent adjustments
                in macro games and near perfect ‘big picture’ game management. Players like Maru or sOs outdid him in
                comparatively minor facets of the game—unit control or psychological warfare, for example—but Zest, at
                his peak, was simply better overall. He played ‘normal’ so well he set new standards for everyone else,
                and always appeared to know more than his opponents, even if his execution occasionally let him
                down—such as his infamous macro slips.

                Looking at Zest’s play now, you would struggle to identify the same player. He seems erratic at times,
                stubborn in the strategies he chooses, and prone to error in decision-making. What we used to identify
                as weaknesses in an extremely competent player—small scale execution and unit control—appear to have
                become strengths. It appears as if the script has been flipped on its head. In 2018, we instead get
                scrappy fights, sometimes accompanied (and often caused) by mind-boggling decision-making… yet
                ultimately still very impressive results. Zest no longer passes the eye test, but his results show a
                very good player nonetheless.

                Zest was always steady. Not in results, perhaps, but in his approach to the game. He stuck with what
                worked and crafted new strategies when the old ones no longer sufficed. Why is it, then, that, after
                years of success, a player like Zest would so drastically overhaul himself?

                We can only speculate. However, Zest always appeared to profit massively from KT Rolster’s team
                environment. His play was always structured, his strategies tried and true. That is the result of the
                support of practice partners and coaches. Living in a house with Stats, Flash, TY, and others no doubt
                gave Zest the opportunity to play multiple games against opponents of different races and perfectly
                refine himself, find any and all possible adjustments and sound out his weaknesses. He would also
                experience what players around him had particular success or trouble with, and could work intelligently
                towards exploring or countering those strategies himself. But KT Rolster no longer fields a StarCraft II
                division. Zest, as almost everyone else in Korea, suddenly had to adjust to life outside of KeSPA. Zest
                was not the only player to fall off then. Many did, and not all have picked themselves up. However,
                those that did rediscovered their old styles of play after getting used to a new lifestyle. Think of
                INnoVation, soO, Stats or Dark—players who, after a period of finding their feet in the wild, came back
                and had success using the same abilities they had before. Some even talk about blossoming outside a very
                restrictive and rigorous atmosphere.

                Not Zest. Instead, he has expressed difficulty at maintaining his practice, and succumbing to laziness
                at times. He took longer than most. No coaches to monitor his play and point out potential issues. No
                teammates to practice specific strategies with over and over again. Only Zest and the ladder, with
                online tournaments to earn money from and try his ladder-crafted strategies in tournament settings.
                Zest’s approach to the game remains similar—he sticks to what works for him. However, what that is has
                drastically changed. Instead of the elaborate macro game, brutal execution of powerful strategies is now
                what brings in the money for him. Zest’s playstyle has become more abusive, but also more chaotic when
                the plan fails as there is no longer a finely tailored backup plan thought out with practice partners.
                Thinking on his feet in unexplored situations was never Zest’s biggest strength, but he finds himself in
                them more often than he used to, and that’s when he looks poor.</p>
