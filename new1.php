   echo $text="It is a long 
established fact that a reader 
will be distracted 
by the readable content of a 
page when looking at its layout. 
The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
is that it has a 
more-or-less normal distribution of 
letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
content here', making it look like readable English. 
Many desktop publishing packages and web 
page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their 
default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' 
will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
Various versions have evolved over the years, 
sometimes by accident, sometimes on 
purpose (injected humour and the like).

/*PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and 
more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first 
version of PHP way back in 1994.

PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".

PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to
 manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
